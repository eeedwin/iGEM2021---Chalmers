## Load libraries
```{r, echo=FALSE}

library(flowCore)
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(hexbin)
library(data.table)
library(ggpubr)

filter = dplyr::filter
select = dplyr::select

```

## Load data

All data is in csv format in the "../data/2021-08-27_at_08-43-55am" folder
```{r,warning=FALSE}
filenames = list.files(path = "../Data/FACS_2021_09_09/iGEM_992021 23858 PM/Sample_Group_1/",full.names = T)

# Extract plate position from filename
plate_pos = filenames %>% gsub(".CSV","",.) %>% gsub(".*am.","",.)

# Loop through and merge all files into a big tibble
tbl = tibble()
for (i in 1:length(filenames)) {
  tbl_file = fread(filenames[i]) %>% mutate(POS = plate_pos[i])
  tbl = rbind(tbl,tbl_file)
}
rm(tbl_file) 
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
